/*

Assignment 6a: Create a class named Counter that has an event named ThresholdReached. 
 This event should be raised when a counter value equals or exceeds a threshold value.
   The event should have two arguments - the threshold value and the date/time the 
   threshold was reached.  You will not need to create a class or instance variables
    for the event - look into how you can package arguments into an event using
     the EventHandler<TEventArgs> (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
      delegate.  Write a Main function to test your Counter class and the event handling.
